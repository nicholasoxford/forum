we are in the business of create jaw dropping customer experiences

This is a Turborepo mono repo

we are using Bun as our package manager.

we are using Next.js as our framework.

we are using Tailwind CSS as our UI library.

we are using TypeScript as our programming language.

I like to name files in kebab case.

## Adding components

To add components to your app, run the following command at the root of your `web` app:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -c apps/web
```

This will place the ui components in the `packages/ui/src/components` directory.

## Tailwind

Your `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` are already set up to use the components from the `ui` package.

## Using components

To use the components in your app, import them from the `ui` package.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/button";
```

Add components to packages/ui/

This project will pay people for being in group chats

It uses the transfer fee mechanism from Token 22 on Solana
https://spl.solana.com/token-2022/extensions#transfer-fees

And uses something called vertigo: https://vertigo.gitbook.io/vertigo-docs

You will launch a token that will create a groupchat on telegram

To be apart of this groupchat you will need to hold a certain amount of tokens 

Every time this token gets swapped we acrue fees and then hourly we will distrubte them to all holders

This is inspired by infite money glitch https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/infinite-money-glitch
